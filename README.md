# Helper scripts to interact with Pi-hole

This is a personal collection of helpers I wrote while working on [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole).
Feels free to use them as well.

1. Pihole Adlist tool got its [own repo](https://github.com/yubiuser/pihole_adlist_tool).
2. `pihole_FTL_API.sh` is a small tool to query the new API introduced with FTLv6 from shell. [Documentation](./pihole_FTL_API.md)
3. `padd_size_checker.sh` will print the terminal size and the respective `$padd_size` when resizing the terminal window.
4. `pihole_sync.sh` to sync a main v6 Pi-hole to a secondary v6 via Teleporter down/uploading [proof-of-concept].
